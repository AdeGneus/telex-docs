# Activate Custom Integrations

Custom integrations in Telex enable tailored workflows by connecting with third-party tools and services that support webhook-based communication. Follow these steps to add and activate a custom integration from the Telex dashboard.

### Activating a Custom Integration

1. **Open the Integrations Marketplace**  
   Navigate to the **Apps** section from your Telex dashboard to access the Integrations Marketplace.

2. **Add a Custom Integration**  
   Select **Add Integration** to begin setting up a custom integration. Creators are required to provide a configuration json file upon adding a custom integration. The configuration json should obey the [required format](../custom-integrations/creating_integration.md) and structure for the integration to be successfully added.

### Manage Custom Integrations
Once your custom integration is active, manage its configuration and operation through the Telex dashboard. Telex custom integrations can function as **Input Integrations** (receiving data) or **Output Integrations** (sending data).
